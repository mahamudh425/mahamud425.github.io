## How to deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo named `<username>.github.io` (replace with your GitHub username).

3. Commit and push.
4. Visit `https://<username>.github.io` to see your site live.

### Customizing
- Edit owner name, tagline, email in the small JSON object at the top of `index.html` or directly in the HTML text.
- Replace `assets/profile.svg` with your own profile image named `profile.jpg` or `profile.png` and update the `<img>` tag if needed.
- Adjust colors in `assets/styles.css`.
